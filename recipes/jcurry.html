        <h2>Japanese Curry -- easy to make at home!</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One box Japanese curry roux. (<em>When I'm feeling lazy, I use Japanese curry roux from the box</em>, but <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-curry-roux/">JustOneCookbook has a great homemade Japanese curry roux recipe!</a>)</li>
            <li>2 large carrots</li>
            <li>Potatoes (<em>Note: I use 6 small red potatoes, Yukon will do</em>)</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 small apple</li>
            <li>1 knob ginger</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soysauce (<em>Note: I like Kikkoman</em>)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
            <li>4 cups <strong>low- or no-sodium</strong> vegetable stock (or chicken/beef)</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp neutral oil (<em>I usually use a spray-on oil like Pam, but if you don't have one, any neutral tasting oil will do</em>)</li>
            <li>Frozen seafood mix -- I like Trader Joe's brand, any non-fatty fish will do</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Japanese short-grain rice (according to how much curry you'll eat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How to cook</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse 1-2 rice-cooker-cups rice, and let sit for about 20 minutes. Then cook per manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Cut onions in half, then, with the cut-side on the cutting board, slice vertically. You should have long pieces of onion. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Scrub and peel potatoes and carrots. Cut potatoes in half. For the carrots, I use the <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/rangiri/">rangiri method outlined on JustOneCookbook's website.</a> Set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel the apple, and cut in half. Core it. Grate the apple using a grater, or finely chop (the apple will mostly dissolve in the curry anyway). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Use either a garlic press or a garlic grater for the garlic and ginger. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using a large pot over medium heat, add your oil (<em>or spray with Pam</em>).</li>
            <li>Once the oil is shimmering nicely, add the onion. Cook the onion down until it just begins to caramelize.</li>
            <li>Add the grated garlic and grated ginger to the onions.</li>
            <li>Add the frozen seafood bag (as-is) to the pot. Cook until you can see the color return in the shrimp.</li>
            <li>Add the veggie stock.</li>
            <li>Add your grated or chopped apple, ketchup, honey, and soy sauce. My Japanese students told me that instant coffee was also a nice addition to curry. Some also liked chocolate (dark, of course).</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and potatoes.</li>
            <li>Simmer, with the pot covered, for about twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>When you can pierce a potato effortlessly, you can begin adding the curry roux.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, and put a block of the curry roux in a cooking spoon. Ladle the liquid into the spoon, and using a fork or a pair of chopsticks, mush up the roux block so that it's integrated. Repeat for the entire box of the curry roux.</li>
            <li>Turn heat back on, and simmer unconvered for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Test the curry at this point. Add salt to taste (for me, roughly 2 tsp).</li>
        </ol>
            <h5>Serving</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Serve curry with steamed rice.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Japanese curry is a favorite among many Japanese families, and tourists who come to Japan! In fact, it's so popular, that when I make it, my cat, Helga, looks on jealously as I won't give her any :-)</p>
