            <p>The basis for this recipe is from <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/best-lentil-soup-recipe/">Cookie and Kate's blog.</a> I cannot take any credit for this recipe, but I WILL say that I definitely vouch that this is, in fact, the greatest lentil soup out there!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup of green or brown lentils, picked over for duds</li>
                <li>1 can of low- or no-sodium tomatoes, lightly drained</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic (to taste -- some of us enjoy the taste coming through)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>3 carrots</li>
                <li>2 stalks celery (optional -- I don't add myself, but to complete the mirepoix, will add nice taste)</li>
                <li>4 cups low- or no-sodium vegetable broth</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam massala OR curry powder. Note, the <a href="../recipes/jcurry.html">Japanese curry roux from my last recipe</a> will NOT work as a substitute here</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to make</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice and dice your onion and celery, set aside</li>
                <li>Peel and chop carrots, set aside</li>
                <li>Use a garlic grater or press garlic, set aside</li>
                <li>I usually take this time to do a few menial tasks to facilitate the rest of the cooking process here: I measure out my spices, I use a can opener to open the can of tomatoes. You can also separate the kale from the stems and roughly chop at this stage, although the kale will be used at a later time.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add onions, celery, and carrots. Stir regularly.</li>
                <li>When onions are translucent and carrots have softened, add garlic, cumin, oregano, and garam massala/curry. Stir constantly until aromatic (about 30 seconds).</li>
                <li>Add canned tomatoes, continuing to stir.</li>
                <li>Pour in lentils, broth, and water. Add 1 tsp salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmering. Cook for 30 minutes with the pot partially covered.</li>
                <li>Transfer 2 cups soup to a blender. Cover top of blender with a tea towel/small clean cooking rag, and blend until pureed. Return soup to pot, integrate.</li>
                <li>Add chopped dino kale, cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add salt, pepper, lemon, whatever you like, to taste.</li>
            </ol>

                <p>Usually when the soup is in the pot cooking away at this state, I have to resist the urge to gobble it up right then!</p>
