        <p><strong>Ginger scales</strong> is how my fianc√© and I decided to call this dish. In essence, it's rice soaked in ginger, soy sauce, mirin, and sake; miso-marinaded salmon; and shocked salted spinach. We came up with the name, actually, because I didn't want to have a long file name for this project, haha.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Miso salmon</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skin-on salmon fillets</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp miso</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mirin (a Japanese cooking wine)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce (<em>I like Kikkoman</em>)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ginger rice</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 knob ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 Tbps soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Salted spinach</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bag baby spinach</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 piece kombu</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soysauce</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <strong>Cooking the miso salmon</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Assuming you have deboned and descaled your fish, begin by mixing the wet ingredients together (everything except the salmon) in a large bowl. Combine.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon into the bowl, skin-side up. Spoon some of the remaining marinade over the skin-side of the fish.</li>
        <li>Keep in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours <strong>maximum.</strong> Although it may be tempting to marinade for longer, the fish will become too salty and quite unpleasant to the taste -- 1-2 hours is ideal.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F with a rack lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Remove marinade from fish. Miso burns easily, leaving you with a bitter, nasty taste if a large amount is left on any of the pieces of fish.</li>
        <li>Bake salmon for roughly 18-20 minutes, testing with an internal thermometer to ensure fish is cooked to a USDA recommended 120F.</li>
        <li>(Optional) Broil the salmon for 3-5 minutes, until a nice char forms.</li>
        <li>The marinade is definitely unusable now; discard.</li>

    </ol>
    <strong>Cooking the ginger rice</strong>
    <p>I recommend preparing and cooking the ginger rice whilst the salmon is marinading, particularly if you're using a rice cooker. A rice cooker will keep your rice hot until ready to plate -- there's also no harm in preparing the ginger rice first, except that the aroma is so delightful that you'll want to dig in sooner.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and drain your rice well.</li>
        <li>Peel ginger and julienne into small strips.</li>
        <li>Mix soy, mirin, sake, in a measuring cup (I usually use my Pyrex here). Add water so that the total liquid is around 1.5 cups of liquid. Add salt, and mix very well.</li>
        <li>Put your drained rice into the rice cooker. Add the liquid from your Pyrex into the rice cooker and <strong>do not stir.</strong></li>
        <li>Let rice soak for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook rice on "Mixed rice" option if available. If none is available, cook for a few minutes longer on a regular setting.</li>
        <li>Once your rice cooker has sung its little melody to let you know the rice is finished, let sit for another 10 minutes before fluffing with paddle.</li>
    </ol>
<strong>Cooking the spinach</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Put your water and kombu into a saucepan.</li>
    <li>Slowly bring to boil. Once boiling, remove kombu.</li>
    <li>Add mirin and soy sauce to the water, and mix. Turn off heat once boiling.</li>
    <li>Rinse and clean spinach. Boil a large pot of water.</li>
    <li>Once the water is boiling, add salt. Put the spinach into the pot, and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer spinach to ice bath. Once cooled, collect spinach on paper towel and squeeze dry/pat dry.</li>
    <li>Put spinach into airtight container and pour the sauce (with the soy and mirin) over the spinach.</li>
    <li>Let soak in refrigerator, roughly 1 hour. If you're impatient, it'll still taste pretty good earlier. :-)</li>
</ol>
<strong>To serve</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Spoon some rice onto plate in attractive fashion. Add a piece of salmon. Finally, add some of your spinach. You can warm the spinach up in the microwave if you prefer.</li>
</ul>
