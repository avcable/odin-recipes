        <p><strong>Ginger scale</strong> is how my fianc√© and I decided to call this dish. In essence, it's rice soaked in ginger, soy sauce, mirin, and sake; miso-basted salmon; and shocked salted spinach. We came up with the name, actually, because I didn't want to have a long file name for this project, haha.</p>
